Key OOP principles in Python include:

Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class).
Inheritance: Allowing one class to inherit the properties and methods of another class.
Polymorphism: The ability for different classes to define methods with the same name, but with different behaviors.
Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features to the user.
OOP in Python promotes modular, maintainable, and reusable code.
